        <p>In early 2023, the administration of Linn-Benton Community College announced a round of budget cuts for the
            end of the 2023-24 academic year<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>. The Computer Systems department was to be
            cut in its entirety, which
            means the Computer Science transfer programs, Network and Systems Administration applied programs, and the
            Systems Administration Certificate program would no longer be offered to new students. As reported in the
            local Albany Democrat-Herald, the cuts were preceded by a long-running decline in enrollment and state
            funding that's lasted over a decade<sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>. In the most recent adopted budget,
            President Lisa Avery describes a
            set of revenue sources substantially reliant on the state's Community College Support Fund, as 'State Aid'<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup>. Further, a graph of historical revenue in the document tracks a "period of divestment" in which every
            source of revenue has increased at sub-inflationary rates since the 2008-09 biennium. The cuts were
            extremely controversial and prompted impassioned letters. Among many others: the State Librarian and wrote
            in response to the
            loss of all library full-time staff<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>, and concerned faculty wrote in response
            to the Computer System
            department's closure<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a></sup>. Despite this, the move is extraordinarily unlikely to
            be
            overturned.</p>
        <p>LBCC's next cohort of would-be computer science students will then be forced to enroll simultaneously in
            another community college if they are to avoid the unnecessary cost of transferring to a four-year
            institution without any major-specific credits. Of course, these students would have only arrived at LBCC
            after deciding the logistical considerations (such as a lengthy commute) did not make it worthwhile to
            simply attend another community college instead. Because Oregon's universities have unique requirements and
            course equivalencies, it will be necessary for the student to verify their courses will transfer ahead of
            time. Oregon's community colleges offer Major Transfer Maps (MTMs), Associate of Science Oregon Transfer in
            Computer Science (ASOT-CS), and specific Associate of Science (AS) programs, all of which are usually
            tailored to one or several four-year institutions.</p>

        <p>The National Center for Education Statistics' College Navigator<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup> was used to
            collate all 17 of Oregon's
            Community College. Though filtering is offered based on Program or Major, anomalies were found that made the
            data unreliable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="list-disc">Umpqua Community College advertises a Computer Science program, but College Navigator
                does not list Umpqua as having any offerings under their "Computer and Information Sciences and Support
                Services" category<sup><a href="#8">[8]</a></sup>.
            </li>
            <li class="list-disc">Clatsop Community College does not advertise a Computer Science program, but College
                Navigator shows one award for "Computer Science" conferred in 2021-2022.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Therefore, the websites of every community college (less Linn-Benton) were laboriously searched for
            advertisement for a computer science transfer program. Immediate offerings of distance learnings advertised
            on the program page were recorded.</p>
        <p>College Navigator data on the community colleges offering programs (and LBCC) was exported from the system.
            Address, Net-price, Setting, and whether campus housing was offered was extracted for further
            reference.<b> </b>College head-count and enrollment by subject were taken from the HECC's Community College

        <p>The dataset, reliability of the data and the strength of the recommendations that can be drawn from them is
            limited. The inconsistencies found in the NCES data create further questions of completeness of the data. In
            the absence of outside context from experts, it was challenging to find more relevant datasets. Further, a
            lot of vital information students would likely want to evaluate colleges using is not attainable from the
            websites
            of the institution alone, and substantial addition research time would have been required to request
            qualitative and quantitative information from each relevant community college. The quality of each
            institution's program is especially hard to qualify using the available statistics, and the HECC data on
            enrollment in CS & Engineering positions can only loosely estimate the popularity of related courses at the
            colleges.</p>
        <p>Further, information about degree requirements and course articulations is available online, but extremely
            time-consuming and error-prone to navigate without the assistance of professional advisors, in addition to
            being subject to change. The portability of credits will probably be a prime consideration in students
            considering enrolling in another community college, but it can only be evaluated ideally by contacting both
            the university and partner community college in question.</p>

        <p>Students near LBCC looking to attend another community college in person would be best served at Chemeketa or
            Lane. These institutions have lengthy commutes from Albany, but they both offer Computer Science transfer
            programs.</p>
        <p>Students interesting in remote learning have substantially more (and more flexible) options. Portland
            Community College has the highest net price of the three institutions that explicitly advertised remote
            learning opportunities, but students could possibly benefit from an 'economy of scale' from the large
            student count and relatively high enrollment in Computer Science and Engineering classes.</p>
